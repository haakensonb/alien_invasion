# Alien Invasion

A simple game based on the classic game Space Invaders

Some of the code in this is part of a follow along tutorial from the book Python Crash Course. 
The book gave me a great base for my first game and I plan to add on my own features as well.

# Getting Started

This game requires Pygame and Python3.

To launch the game you only need to run the file alien_invasion.py
```
python alien_invasion.py
```

# TODO
* Make 'P' a shortcut for play button
* Add sound effects
* Make each alien edge detection independent of each row
* Refactor
* Add bullet upgrades?
* Give aliens bullets or make them switch directions randomly for more challenge
